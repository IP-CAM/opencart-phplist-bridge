PHPLIST BRIDGE

IN5TALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

if you are already running phplist there are 2 options you can take
====== option 1 ====
1. install the module into opencart
2. edit the module configurstion in particular the phplist db prefix field must match as follows databasename.dbprefix (ex. phplistdb.phplist_).
note. both databases must be on the same server also the username and password the phplist database uses must match the opencart database auth credentials.

===== option 2 ======
you can import all your phplist tables into your opencart database (least issues/but potentially large opencart db in filesize)
1. log into phpmyadmin
2. take note of the dbprefix it will look like ex. phplist_tablename. phplist_ is the prefix.
3. export the tables
4. import the tables into your opencart database
5. fix your phplist config to point to the new db
6. install the module into opencart
7. edit the module configuration in particular the phplist db prefix field must match the dbprefix phplist uses.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

if you are not running phplist
1. download phplist
2. install using your opencart database as the installation db.
3. install the module into opencart
4. edit the module configuration in particular the phplist db prefix field must match the dbprefix phplist uses.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

potential issues:

Sometimes if you use cpanel and install via softtaculous, you will not be given suffecent permissions to do a complete db export, the users and other tables will be locked, you can verify this by loggin into phpmyadmin and trying to browse/edit the users table. 

If you do this method check that the use and password for both the opencart install and phplist, its under add user to the database in cpanel.

When you are using different database to store phplist, sometines there is a prefix which does not show in cpanel, you may see under databases __ccmail, but is does not show you there is really a dbprefix of username__ccmail.
